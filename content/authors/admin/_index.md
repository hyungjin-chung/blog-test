[**I moved to a new site**](https://hyungjin-chung.github.io/)

I am a **Research Scientist, advisory member** at [EverEx](https://everex.kr/), where I lead the AI research team together with [Byung-Hoon Kim](https://egyptdj.github.io/cv/). Before joining EverEx, I did my Ph.D. at [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/) where I was advised by [Jong Chul Ye](https://bispl.weebly.com/). During my Ph.D., I also spent my time as a research intern at [NVIDIA Research](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/research/), [Google Research](https://research.google/), and [Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL)](https://www.lanl.gov/). I pioneered and advanced some of the most widely acknowledged works on diffusion model-based inverse problem solvers. I'm interested broadly in the intersection of generative models, representation learning, and their applications to real-world problems. Here is my [CV](https://github.com/hyungjin-chung/blog-test/blob/master/static/media/CV_Hyungjin_Chung.pdf) and [Research Statement](https://github.com/hyungjin-chung/blog-test/blob/master/static/media/Research_Statement_Hyungjin_Chung.pdf).

I am looking for highly motivated researchers to work with me at [EverEx](https://everex.kr/). If you are interested, send me an email with your CV attached.
